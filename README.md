# Shading constraint improves accuracy of time-of-flight measurements
A naïve implementation of the Fast Bilateral-Space Stereo paper by Martin Böhme. [1] [2]
The goal of this project was to get practical experience of this method.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are needed.  
The version numbers are the ones used during development.  
- OpenCV 3.2.0 [http://opencv.org/](http://opencv.org/)
- LibTiff 4.0.7 [http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/)

The code was developed on a Windows machine with Visual Studio 2015.
